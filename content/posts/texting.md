With the evolution of time, the mediums of communications are also changed and texting is one of the most popular mode of communication that is used widely now and we uses it on daily bases.

But I have noticed that when we text or chat with someone it just doesn’t seems as good as in-person interaction, consequently many people starts to get anxiety at some point.

Anxiety while texting is pretty common nowadays, we get anxious very quickly if someone is not replying our text from last two hours, or have left our message on seen, moreover we create assumptions in our minds e.g.
“Why the one is not replying ?”
“Have I said something wrong ?”
“I think I am being ignored purposefully, why is he/she doing that so ? ”

The problem arises when we start to create fake perceptions of other people in our mind without thinking rationally, we directly make assumptions and overthink them. You may think that you are being ignored but the reality might be different, Not everyone’s habit are same, not everyone has habit of being with their phone all the day; every people has their own priorities and sometimes they they don’t want to text at all, but that doesn’t mean that they are being rude to you are is ignoring you.

#### Texting is emotionless.

Yes, texting is totally emotionless, you won’t know whether the person you are talking to is happy, crying or is depressed. The way people use to show emotions is _emojis_, which is unreliable and even a depressed person can send few laughing emojis and you might think that the person is happy but that might not be the truth.

You cannot predict how the other person might be feeling when you are texting them. Face expression, body language and the way a person talks is very crucial thing for any kind of communication.

#### Why we prefer texting over calls / actual meet ?

Texting is not entirely full of cons, it has it’s pros too. Meeting some stranger directly might be awkward to some people and not all people are that good at socialising ( including me ). Thus, texting can be a good way to kickstart a small conversation, get to know a person little and being comfortable with them at some extent. Also that awkward silences we face in call might be avoided by texting, because texting provides us some time to think for the reply.

Also, you can start a conversation about anything in texting after a break of few minutes/hours/days and it will go on just smoothly.

#### What is the game of texting ?

“The game of texting” is a new trend that teenagers are following nowadays, it includes guides about how can you text better to make a girlfriend, how can you seduce someone etc.

I have gone through this on internet and found that there are many communities online who are giving texting advises, and also there rules for what and how you should text one! I was astonished at the moment when I found there are millions of followers of this game all around.

People were giving advises like, don’t text someone first, don’t reply to them to them quickly if they kept you waiting for hours or days, sending emojis is unprofessional, don’t text twice if you aren’t being replied etc etc.. Let me tell you this, some people suck at texting but are great at in-person communication, people are busy and often forget that they got a text and from you and they kept it mind that they might reply you later but then forget later. Forgetting things is pretty much common and is human nature too, but we don’t think rationally at all.

I mean texting isn’t a game at all, you don’t have to follow rules or follow standards for making a damn conversation.

#### What’s my take on it ?

Talking about me, I have always been a person who texts all the time; also used to get anxieties when my messages were ignored or someone changes the way they used to text me. What I have realised lately is texting sometimes becomes much draining and exhausts us.

There is a story behind my realisation. There was a girl I liked, we met at first time at a movie when I was with some mutual friends and after that we started texting each other, I was a teenager at that time and texting apps like WhatsApp, hike, messenger were new and was in trend. We communicated only though the chat for over a year, then finally I got a change to meet her, I was pretty astonished by seeing the behaviour of hers, maybe because I expected a lot more from her that she will talk to me like the same way we were texting, but it turned out totally opposite, she didn’t seem interested at all, she wasn’t even making a basic eye contact. At that time I blamed her that people are like these only, they only text to pass the time and are much different in reality. But the thing was I expected too much because I was constantly texting her all the day, I was building a personality of her in my mind by the way she texts to me and I was liking that personality not that actual person, to be honest this realisation took much time for me but it’s for the good.

Texting is a great way to make things fun, have small nice conversations but it’s worse when you overdoing it and give it the importance over an actual meeting.
