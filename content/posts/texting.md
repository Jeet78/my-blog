With the evolution of time, the methods of communication are also changed and texting is one of the most conventional methods of communication these days and we use it on a daily bases.

When we text or chat it doesn't feel as pleasant as meeting them in-person, consequently many people start to get anxious at some point.

Being anxious while texting is pretty common nowadays, we get anxious very quickly if someone is not replying our text from last two hours or have left our message on seen, moreover we create Hypothetical situations in our minds e.g.
“Why the one is not replying ?”
“Have I said something wrong ?”
“I think I am being ignored purposefully, why is he/she doing that so? ”

The problem arises when we start to create fake perceptions of other people in our mind without thinking rationally, we directly make assumptions and overthink them. You may think that you are being ignored but the reality might be different, Not everyone has a habit of keeping with their phone with themselves all the day; every person has his/her own priorities or maybe sometimes they don’t want to text at all, but that doesn’t mean that they are being rude to you or are is ignoring you.

#### Texting is emotionless.

Yes, texting is totally emotionless, you won’t know whether the person you are talking to is happy, crying or is depressed. The way people use to show emotions is _emojis_, which is unreliable and even a depressed person can send few laughing emojis and you might think that the person is happy but that might not be the truth.

You cannot predict how the other person might be feeling when you are texting them. The facial expression, body language, and the way a person talks is a very crucial thing for any kind of communication.

#### Why do we prefer texting over calls / actual meeting?

Texting is not entirely full of cons, it has it’s pros too. Meeting some strangers directly might be awkward to some people and not all people are that good at socializing ( including me ). Thus, texting can be a good way to kickstart a small conversation, get to know a person little, and being comfortable with them to some extent. Also the awkward silence we face in the call might be avoided by texting, because texting provides us some time to think for the reply.

Also, you can start a conversation about anything in texting after a break of a few minutes/hours/days and it will go on just smoothly.

#### What is the game of texting?

“The game of texting” is a new trend that teenagers are following nowadays, it includes guides about how can you text better to make a girlfriend, how can you seduce someone, etc.

I have gone through this on the internet and found that there are many people online who are giving texting advice, and also their rules for what and how you should text one! I was astonished at the moment when I found there are millions of followers of this game all around.

People were giving advises like, don’t text someone first, don’t reply to them quickly if they kept you waiting for hours or days, sending emojis is unprofessional, don’t text twice if you aren’t being replied, etc.. Let me tell you this, some people suck at texting but are great at in-person communication, people are busy and often forget that they got a text and from you and they kept in mind that they might reply you later but then forget later. Forgetting things is pretty much common and is human nature too, but we don’t think rationally at all.

I mean texting isn’t a game at all, you don’t have to follow rules or follow standards for making a damn conversation.

#### My experience with it.

Talking about me, I have always been a person who texts all the time; also used to get anxieties when my messages were ignored or someone changes the way they used to text me. What I have realized lately is texting sometimes becomes much draining and exhausts us.

There is a story behind my realization. There was a girl I liked, we met for the first time at a movie with some of our mutual friends, Later we started texting each other, I was a teenager at that time. We texted each other for almost over a year, When I finally got a chance to meet her in person, I was pretty astonished by seeing her real self, I had expected to have a healthy conversation with her after texting for such a long time, but it turned out completely opposite, unlike texts she didn’t show any interest as a person to a point she didn't even consider it important to make eye contact. At that time I thought that's how people are! But the thing was I expected too much from her because of constantly exchanging texts with her. I had an image of the kind of person she is coz of the texts but the reality was way too different. it took me a little while to realize it that it was for my own good.

Texting is a great way to make things fun, have small nice conversations but it’s worse when you overdoing it and give it the importance over an actual meeting.
